				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					We are working on controlling Environmental Pollution and preserving the natural environment is our prime objective. We started our River cleanup and restoration effort with the Yamuna River near New Delhi and Agra, India.
				</p>
				<p>
					We'd love to have your support in this effort. The "Yamuna River Remediation Project," in New Delhi, India, was started single-handedly back in October 1992. Since then we have gained support from various organizations and individuals and have now formed a group of dedicated individuals with one goal, one mind, and one motto of one kind - the "Blue Yamuna".
